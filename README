ADDENDUM:

At some point when I get some time I am going to improve the annotate/blame command to make it more usefull:
  1. Include user and date for each line
  2. Have it as a side "tethered" split window. I am pretty sure the git version of blame does this so I will look at that code and replicate for perforce.
I also want to make sure it work correctly for Linux out of the box.

Perforce is a source control system from http://www.perforce.com

Features:
- menu and keyboard shortcuts to open (checkout), revert, and sync files.
- prompts to open a file for editing when you attempt to change a checked-in file.
- perforce status displayed on the ruler.
- tested on Windows operating systems only.

This plugin provides a relatively few commonly used commands. If you are looking for the ability to carry out many perforce commands from within vim, you may wish to look at  Hari Krishna Dara's plugin (script 240)  at http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=240.
